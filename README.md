# Face_Detection_and_Arduino_Integration
Human face detection system using OpenCV library

"I'm eager to share my most recent endeavor on Github! With Python, I developed a face detection system using the OpenCV package. With a high degree of accuracy, the system recognizes faces, circles them with a square, and gives a confidence level to indicate whether the face is human. Additionally, I used the Arduino IDE to integrate the output with an Arduino Uno, so that when a face is identified, a linked LED turns on. It was a fun task to combine computer vision and hardware interface, and I'm happy with the outcome.
